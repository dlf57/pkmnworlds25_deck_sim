    "The simulated Day 2 meta was not all that far off from the Day 1 prediction. I think the big surprises are Grimmsnarl falling out of the top 5 graphic and raging bolt getting a large boost. A major note to make, I am setting Zoroark and Blissey to 50% win in every matchup as I have no meta information at this time on these deck's performances. I did drop Crustle and Ethan's Typhlosion because I do not believe any made Day 2.\n",
